        <p>
          CryptoNexus is a lightweight interface for exploring
          cryptocurrency data and market trends. It provides curated
          information from CoinGecko APIs so you can quickly find coin
          metadata, track market movements, and discover new projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our goal is to provide a fast, distraction-free experience
          for both newcomers and experienced traders. We focus on
          clarity of information, sensible defaults, and a small set
          of useful tools that help you make sense of the market
          without overwhelming you.
